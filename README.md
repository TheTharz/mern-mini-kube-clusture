# MERN Mini Kube Cluster

This project sets up a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) on a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Follow the steps below to deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Minikube
- Kubectl
- AWS EC2 instance (if deploying on AWS)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Minikube

Make sure you have Minikube installed and start it with Docker driver:

```sh
minikube start --driver=docker
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-mini-kube-cluster.git
cd mern-mini-kube-cluster
```

### 3. Apply Kubernetes Configurations

Apply the Kubernetes configuration files in the following order:

#### a. Create the Secret

Create the Kubernetes Secret to store sensitive information:

```sh
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

#### b. Apply MongoDB Configuration

Apply the MongoDB ConfigMap or other configuration:

```sh
kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
```

#### c. Deploy MongoDB Application

Deploy the MongoDB application, which includes deployment and service definitions:

```sh
kubectl apply -f mongo-app.yaml
```

#### d. Deploy Web Application

Finally, deploy the web application, which depends on MongoDB:

```sh
kubectl apply -f web-app.yaml
```

### 4. Verify the Deployment

Check that all pods and services are running correctly:

```sh
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

To get detailed information about a specific pod or service:

```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

### 5. Access the Web Application

Retrieve the URL of the web application service and open it in your browser:

```sh
minikube service webapp-service
```

### Notes

- Ensure that your AWS EC2 instance has the necessary permissions and security group settings to allow traffic to and from Minikube.
- If deploying on AWS, you may need to set up proper networking configurations and security group settings.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with starting Minikube, ensure Docker is running and configured correctly.
- For issues with Kubernetes resources, use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to check the logs of a specific pod.

## Cleanup

To delete all resources created by these configurations:

```sh
kubectl delete -f web-app.yaml
kubectl delete -f mongo-app.yaml
kubectl delete -f mongo-config.yaml
kubectl delete -f secret.yaml
minikube stop
```
